# PicoXR_EyeTracking_Demo

There is an upcoming update of the eye tracking API scheduled for March 2023. If no major changes are made and the project continues to function properly, the source code will be made available on this repository. Meanwhile, below you can find a short demonstration video of what I've developed (click on the image to view the video on Youtube).
